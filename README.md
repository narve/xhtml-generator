# xhtml-generator
Simple, flexible, fluid, dependency-free Java library for generating well-formed xhtml documents and fragments.

This library is intended for programmatical generation of XHTML documents and fragments. It does not validate anything, and does
not prevent developers from doing crazy stuff if they feel like it. But it does provide handy functionality 
for generating elements and setting attribute values. 

See <a href="src/main/java/no/dv8/xhtml/generation/support/Main.java">Main.java</a> for example of usage,
and <a href="output.html">output.html</a> for output generated by this code.

xhtml-generator uses virtual extension methods and lambdas, so it requires java 8 both for compiling and using. 

This library is still missing lots of elements and attributes - I add them as I need them. If you use it, please contribute whatever you miss. Pull requests are welcome :)
