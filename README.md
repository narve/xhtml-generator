# xhtml-generator
Simple, flexible, fluid, dependency-free Java library for generating well-formed xhtml documents and fragments.

This library is intended for programmatical generation of XHTML documents and fragments. It does not validate anything, and does
not prevent developers from doing crazy stuff if they feel like it. But it does provide handy functionality 
for generating elements and setting attribute values. 

See <a href="src/main/java/no/dv8/xhtml/generation/support/Main.java">Main.java</a> for example of usage and output.
